    "## 🎓 What You Learned!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's review what we built:\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ The System\n",
    "1. **Gets data** from Crime APIs and 311 APIs\n",
    "2. **Saves data** to AWS S3 (cloud storage)\n",
    "3. **Assigns risk** to each incident (1, 2, or 3)\n",
    "4. **Measures distance** from incidents to paths\n",
    "5. **Calculates risk** using the magic formula\n",
    "6. **Returns** the 3 safest paths\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧮 The Math\n",
    "**Formula (with time decay!):** \n",
    "- **For w=3:** f(d,t,w) = (ReLU(3-3t/72))² × e^(-d²/0.02)\n",
    "- **For w=1,2:** f(d,t,w) = (ReLU(w-wt/24))² × e^(-d²/0.02)\n",
    "- **w** = Risk value (1, 2, or 3)\n",
    "- **d** = Distance in kilometers\n",
    "- **Lower total** = Safer path! 🎯\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔑 Key Concepts\n",
    "- **API**: How programs get data from websites\n",
    "- **S3**: Cloud storage (like Google Drive for computers)\n",
    "- **Geodesic**: Distance on Earth's surface\n",
    "- **Risk Score**: A number showing how dangerous a path is\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "**To use with real data:**\n",
    "1. Get API keys for Crime and 311 data\n",
    "2. Set up AWS account\n",
    "3. Create S3 bucket\n",
    "4. Fill in credentials in the notebook\n",
    "5. Run the main function!\n",
    "\n",
    "**To learn more:**\n",
    "- Read about APIs: \"How do websites share data?\"\n",
    "- Learn about AWS: \"What is cloud computing?\"\n",
    "- Study the formula: \"How does exponential decay work?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎉 You Did It!\n",
    "\n",
    "You now have a complete path safety analysis system!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember:**\n",
    "- Lower risk scores = Safer paths\n",
    "- The formula balances distance and danger\n",
    "- This works for any area with accessible data!\n",
    "\n",
    "Happy analyzing! 🗺️✨\n"
