## Core Algorithm Overview

SafePath SF uses a modified **A* (A-star)** pathfinding algorithm that optimizes for both safety and efficiency. Unlike traditional navigation that minimizes distance or time, we minimize a composite risk function.

### Base Cost Function
```
f(n) = g(n) + h(n) + s(n)
```
Where:
- `f(n)` = Total cost of node n
- `g(n)` = Distance from start to node n
- `h(n)` = Heuristic estimate from n to goal (Euclidean distance)
- `s(n)` = Safety penalty for node n

---

## Safety Score Calculation

### 1. Grid-Based Risk Assessment

The city is divided into a grid where each cell has a safety score based on historical crime data:

```python
# Safety score for grid cell (i, j)
S(i,j) = 1 - (W_crime * C(i,j) + W_time * T(i,j) + W_light * L(i,j))
```

Where:
- `C(i,j)` = Normalized crime rate [0,1]
- `T(i,j)` = Time-based risk factor [0,1]
- `L(i,j)` = Lighting conditions factor [0,1]
- `W_crime`, `W_time`, `W_light` = Weight coefficients (sum to 1)

### 2. Crime Density Calculation

Crime density uses **Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)**:

```
œÅ(x,y) = (1/nh¬≤) * Œ£ K((x-xi)/h, (y-yi)/h)
```

Where:
- `K` = Gaussian kernel function
- `h` = Bandwidth parameter (typically 500m for urban areas)
- `(xi, yi)` = Location of crime incident i
- `n` = Total number of incidents

### 3. Temporal Risk Factor

Time-based risk using **Poisson distribution**:

```
P(k crimes in time t) = (Œªt)^k * e^(-Œªt) / k!
```

Where:
- `Œª` = Average crime rate per hour
- `t` = Time window (hours)
- `k` = Number of crimes

## Route Optimization

### 1. Modified Dijkstra's Algorithm

We use a weighted graph where edge weights incorporate safety scores:

```python
# Edge weight between nodes u and v
w(u,v) = d(u,v) * (1 + Œ± * (1 - S_avg(u,v)))
```

Where:
- `d(u,v)` = Physical distance between nodes
- `S_avg(u,v)` = Average safety score along edge
- `Œ±` = Safety importance factor (user-adjustable, 0-10)

### 2. Dynamic Programming Approach

For multi-waypoint routes, we solve using dynamic programming:

```
OPT(i,S) = min{OPT(j,S\{i}) + w(j,i)} for all j in S\{i}
```

Where:
- `OPT(i,S)` = Optimal path ending at i, visiting all nodes in set S
- `S\{i}` = Set S excluding node i

---

## Graph Theory Implementation

### 1. Graph Construction

Streets are represented as a weighted directed graph G(V,E):

```
G = (V, E, W)
V = {intersection points}
E = {street segments}
W = {safety-weighted distances}
```

### 2. Betweenness Centrality

We calculate street importance using betweenness centrality:

```
CB(v) = Œ£(s‚â†v‚â†t) [œÉst(v) / œÉst]
```

Where:
- `œÉst` = Total shortest paths from s to t
- `œÉst(v)` = Shortest paths from s to t passing through v

### 3. Community Detection

Safe zones are identified using **Louvain modularity**:

```
Q = (1/2m) * Œ£ij [Aij - (ki*kj)/(2m)] * Œ¥(ci,cj)
```

Where:
- `Aij` = Adjacency matrix
- `ki` = Degree of node i
- `m` = Total number of edges
- `Œ¥(ci,cj)` = 1 if nodes i,j are in same community, 0 otherwise

---

## Machine Learning Models

### 1. Logistic Regression for Risk Prediction

```
P(crime) = 1 / (1 + e^(-(Œ≤‚ÇÄ + Œ≤‚ÇÅx‚ÇÅ + Œ≤‚ÇÇx‚ÇÇ + ... + Œ≤‚Çôx‚Çô)))
```

Features include:
- Distance to police stations
- Proximity to businesses (24hr vs closed)
- Historical crime patterns
- Street lighting density
- Foot traffic estimates

### 2. Random Forest for Route Classification

The model uses **Gini impurity** for splits:

```
Gini = 1 - Œ£(pi)¬≤
```

Where `pi` = Proportion of samples in class i

### 3. Neural Network Architecture

Three-layer feedforward network:
```
Input Layer (7 features) ‚Üí Hidden Layer (64 neurons, ReLU) ‚Üí 
Hidden Layer (32 neurons, ReLU) ‚Üí Output Layer (safety score)
```

Activation function (ReLU):
```
f(x) = max(0, x)
```

Loss function (MSE):
```
L = (1/n) * Œ£(yi - ≈∑i)¬≤
```

---

## Time-Safety Trade-off

### 1. Pareto Optimization

We find Pareto-optimal routes where no objective can be improved without worsening another:

```
minimize: [T(route), R(route)]
```
Where:
- `T(route)` = Total travel time
- `R(route)` = Total risk score

### 2. Weighted Sum Method

User preference Œ± ‚àà [0,1] balances time vs safety:

```
Score(route) = Œ± * T_norm(route) + (1-Œ±) * R_norm(route)
```

Where normalized values are:
```
T_norm = (T - T_min) / (T_max - T_min)
R_norm = (R - R_min) / (R_max - R_min)
```

### 3. Constraint Satisfaction

Routes must satisfy:
```
T(route) ‚â§ T_max = T_shortest * (1 + Œ≤)
R(route) ‚â§ R_threshold
```
Where Œ≤ = Maximum time increase factor (typically 0.3 or 30%)

## Statistical Analysis

### 1. Bayesian Inference for Real-time Updates

Prior probability updated with new crime data:

```
P(safe|data) = P(data|safe) * P(safe) / P(data)
```

### 2. Confidence Intervals

95% confidence interval for safety scores:

```
CI = Œº ¬± 1.96 * (œÉ/‚àön)
```

### 3. Spatial Autocorrelation (Moran's I)

Testing for crime clustering:

```
I = (n/W) * [Œ£ij wij(xi-xÃÑ)(xj-xÃÑ)] / [Œ£i(xi-xÃÑ)¬≤]
```

Where:
- `wij` = Spatial weight between zones i and j
- `W` = Sum of all spatial weights
- `xÃÑ` = Mean crime rate

## Implementation Example

```python
def calculate_safe_route(start, end, time_of_day):
    # Build graph with safety weights
    G = build_weighted_graph(city_map, crime_data, time_of_day)
    
    # A* with safety heuristic
    def safety_cost(node):
        base_cost = euclidean_distance(node, end)
        safety_penalty = (1 - get_safety_score(node)) * SAFETY_WEIGHT
        return base_cost + safety_penalty
    
    # Find optimal path
    path = a_star(G, start, end, heuristic=safety_cost)
    
    # Calculate metrics
    total_distance = sum(G[u][v]['distance'] for u,v in path)
    avg_safety = mean([get_safety_score(n) for n in path])
    estimated_time = total_distance / WALKING_SPEED
    
    return {
        'path': path,
        'distance': total_distance,
        'safety_score': avg_safety,
        'estimated_time': estimated_time
    }
```
