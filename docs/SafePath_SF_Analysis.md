# Finding the Safest Walking Paths üó∫Ô∏è

## What Are We Building?

Imagine you're walking home and Google Maps shows you 5 different routes. This system helps you find the **3 safest routes** by checking:
- **Crime incidents** nearby
- **Street problems** (like broken sidewalks, potholes) nearby

Then it ranks all your routes from safest to most risky.

## Think of it Like This:

If you're choosing between walking through:
1. A well-lit, busy street with no problems
2. A dimly lit alley with recent incidents
3. A sidewalk with construction

This system picks Option 1 for you automatically!

## What You'll Need

- A computer with internet
- Basic Python (we'll teach you as we go!)
- Access to crime and 311 data (we'll help you get this)
- AWS account (we'll guide you step-by-step)

## How It Works (Super Simple Version)

```
1. You give us multiple possible routes
2. We look up crime & safety problems along each route
3. We calculate a "danger score" for each route
4. We give you back the 3 routes with LOWEST danger scores
```

The lower the score, the safer the route! üéØ


## üìö Some Important Terms (Don't Worry, We'll Explain!)

Before we start, let's learn a few simple words:

**Polypath** = A walking route (like a list of "turn here, then here")  
**API** = A way to get data from websites (like asking a question and getting an answer)  
**S3** = Amazon's storage (like a filing cabinet in the cloud)  
**Bedrock** = Amazon's AI (smart computer that can understand things)  
**Risk Score** = How dangerous a route is (higher number = more dangerous)

**The Magic Formula:** if w=3, f(d,t,w) = (ReLU(w-w(t/72)))¬≤ √ó e^(-(d)¬≤/0.02), else f(d,t,w) = (ReLU(w-w(t/24)))¬≤ √ó e^(-(d)¬≤/0.02)
- Don't worry about this yet! We'll explain it step by step.
- **d** = distance (things close matter more than far things)
- **t** = time since incident (recent incidents matter more than old ones)
- **ReLU** = makes sure values never go negative
- Just know: "recent and close incidents are more dangerous"


## Step 1: Getting the Tools We Need

Think of this like buying ingredients for a recipe. We need to install some "tools" (called libraries) first.

**What's a library?**  
It's like a toolbox with pre-made tools. Instead of building a hammer from scratch, you just get one from the toolbox!

Run the cell below to install everything:



```python
# This installs the tools we need
# Just like installing apps on your phone!
%pip install boto3 requests numpy pandas geopy --quiet

print("‚úÖ Tools installed! We're ready to start!")

```

    Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.
    ‚úÖ Tools installed! We're ready to start!


## Step 2: Bringing in Our Tools

Now we're going to "import" our tools. Think of it like opening your toolbox.

**Analogy:** Imagine you're cooking:
- You need a knife ‚Üí you "import" it from the kitchen
- You need a cutting board ‚Üí you "import" it from the cupboard

Here, we're importing Python tools from libraries!



```python
# Import = bring in the tools
import boto3        # This talks to Amazon Web Services (AWS)
import requests     # This gets data from the internet
import json         # This reads/writes data in a special format
import numpy as np  # This does math calculations
import pandas as pd  # This organizes data in tables
from geopy.distance import geodesic  # This calculates distances on Earth
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple  # This just helps us write cleaner code

print("‚úÖ All tools loaded! We're ready to work!")
print("\nüí° Tip: The 'import' command loads pre-written code so we don't have to write everything ourselves!")

```

    ‚úÖ All tools loaded! We're ready to work!
    
    üí° Tip: The 'import' command loads pre-written code so we don't have to write everything ourselves!


## Step 3: Setting Up AWS (Amazon Web Services)

**What is AWS?**  
Think of AWS as Amazon's cloud services - it's like renting storage space and smart computers online.

**Why do we need it?**
1. **S3** = We store our data here (like a filing cabinet)
2. **Bedrock** = We use AI to understand how dangerous incidents are

### üìù You Need to Set This Up (Don't Worry, It's Easy!)

1. Go to https://aws.amazon.com
2. Create a free account
3. Go to S3 (looks like a storage symbol)
4. Create a bucket (just click "Create bucket" and name it)
5. Get your credentials (Access Key ID and Secret Key)

**Important:** Never share your credentials! Keep them secret like a password.

### üîß Configuration

Fill in your details below:



```python
# ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Fill in your AWS details here
# You'll get these from your AWS account

# What region are you in? (us-east-1 is a common choice for USA)
AWS_REGION = "us-east-1"  # üåç Change this to your region

# What's your S3 bucket name? (This is where we store data)
S3_BUCKET_NAME = "my-path-risk-data"  # üì¶ Change this to your bucket name

# Now we create the "clients" (think of them as assistants)
# They'll help us talk to AWS
s3_client = boto3.client('s3', region_name=AWS_REGION)
bedrock_client = boto3.client('bedrock-runtime', region_name=AWS_REGION)

print(f"‚úÖ Connected to AWS in region: {AWS_REGION}")
print("üí° If this fails, make sure you've set up your AWS credentials!")

```

    ‚úÖ Connected to AWS in region: us-east-1
    üí° If this fails, make sure you've set up your AWS credentials!


## Step 4: Understanding the Data We'll Get

Before we write code, let's understand what data we're getting.

### Data from Crime API

When police respond to a call, they record it. We get this data like:
```json
{
  "call_type": "ASSAULT WITH WEAPON",
  "location": {
    "latitude": 37.7855,
    "longitude": -122.4090
  }
}
```

### Data from 311 API

When someone reports a street problem (like a pothole), we get data like:
```json
{
  "category": "Sidewalk Hazard",
  "latitude": 37.7852,
  "longitude": -122.4085
}
```

**In simple terms:** We're getting lists of "bad things that happened" with their locations!


## Step 5: Getting Crime Data from the Internet

**What is an API?**  
Think of it like this: You want to know the weather. You ask Google "What's the weather?" and Google gives you the answer. That's how an API works - you ask a question, you get an answer!

**How it works:**
1. We ask the Crime API: "Give me all crimes in this area"
2. It returns a list of crimes
3. We use that list!

Let's write the function:



```python
def fetch_crime_data(area_bounds, api_key=None):
    """
    Get crime data from SF Open Data API.
    
    This is like asking a website: "What crimes happened here?"
    
    Input:
    - area_bounds: Where we want to look (like GPS coordinates of an area)
    - api_key: Not needed for SF Open Data (they allow public access)
    
    Output:
    - A list of crimes that happened in that area
    """
    
    # SF Open Data API endpoint with specific crime types
    api_url = "https://data.sfgov.org/resource/gnap-fj3t.json"
    
    # Query for specific crime types
    query = {
        "$query": """SELECT
  entry_datetime,
  call_type_original_desc,
  call_type_final_desc,
  intersection_name,
  intersection_point
WHERE
  caseless_one_of(
    call_type_original_desc,
    "EXPLOSIVE FOUND",
    "SUSPICIOUS PERSON",
    "FIGHT W/WEAPONS",
    "FIGHT NO WEAPON",
    "ASSAULT / BATTERY DV",
    "PURSE SNATCH",
    "EXPLOSION",
    "ROBBERY",
    "THREATS / HARASSMENT",
    "STRONGARM ROBBERY",
    "INDECENT EXPOSURE",
    "PERSON BREAKING IN",
    "BURGLARY"
  )
ORDER BY entry_datetime DESC NULL LAST""",
        "$limit": 5000  # Limit results
    }
    
    try:
        # Ask the website for data
        response = requests.get(api_url, params=query)
        
        # Check if we got good data back
        response.raise_for_status()
        
        # Convert the response to something we can use
        crimes = response.json()
        
        print(f"‚úÖ Got {len(crimes)} crime incidents from SF Open Data!")
        return crimes
        
    except Exception as e:
        # If something went wrong, tell us
        print(f"‚ùå Error: {e}")
        return []

print("‚úÖ Function created! This function gets crime data from SF Open Data.")
print("\nüí° This queries SF Open Data API for the specific crime types we need!")

```

    ‚úÖ Function created! This function gets crime data from SF Open Data.
    
    üí° This queries SF Open Data API for the specific crime types we need!


## Step 6: Getting 311 Data (Street Problems)

**What is 311?**  
311 is a city service people call to report problems like:
- Broken sidewalks
- Potholes
- Streetlights out
- Trash problems

We want this data because these things make walking unsafe!

**Real Life Example:**  
If there's a "Sidewalk Hazard" report, that means someone could trip and fall. That's dangerous for pedestrians!



```python
def fetch_311_data(area_bounds, api_key=None):
    """
    Get 311 data from SF Open Data API.
    
    This asks: "What street problems (Encampments, Aggressive/Threatening) were reported here?"
    
    Input:
    - area_bounds: Where to look (not used in this implementation, but kept for compatibility)
    - api_key: Not needed for SF Open Data
    
    Output:
    - List of 311 incidents
    """
    
    # SF Open Data 311 API endpoint
    api_url = "https://data.sfgov.org/resource/vw6y-z8j6.json"
    
    # Query for Aggressive/Threatening and Encampment incidents
    query = {
        "$query": """SELECT
  requested_datetime,
  status_description,
  service_name,
  service_subtype,
  point_geom
WHERE
  caseless_one_of(
    service_name,
    "Aggressive/Threatening",
    "Encampment",
    "Encampments"
  )
ORDER BY requested_datetime DESC NULL LAST""",
        "$limit": 5000  # Limit results
    }
    
    try:
        # Ask for the data
        response = requests.get(api_url, params=query)
        response.raise_for_status()
        
        # Get the data
        incidents = response.json()
        
        print(f"‚úÖ Got {len(incidents)} 311 incidents from SF Open Data!")
        return incidents
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"‚ùå Error: {e}")
        return []

print("‚úÖ Function created! This gets Encampment and Aggressive/Threatening reports.")
print("\nüí° This queries SF Open Data API for encampments and threatening behavior!")

```

    ‚úÖ Function created! This gets Encampment and Aggressive/Threatening reports.
    
    üí° This queries SF Open Data API for encampments and threatening behavior!


## Step 7: Saving Data to AWS S3

**What is S3?**  
S3 is Amazon's storage system. Think of it like Google Drive or Dropbox, but for computers.

**Why save it?**  
- Backup: If something goes wrong, we have the data
- Speed: We can load it faster later
- Remember: Computers forget when they restart, we want to save our work!

**Real Life Analogy:**  
It's like saving your homework to the cloud so you can access it from any computer!



```python
def save_to_s3(data, bucket_name, key):
    """
    Save data to S3 (cloud storage).
    
    Think of it like saving a file to your phone's cloud storage.
    
    Input:
    - data: The information we want to save
    - bucket_name: Which "folder" to save it in
    - key: What to name the file
    
    Output:
    - True if saved successfully, False if it failed
    """
    
    try:
        # Convert our data to JSON (a common format for saving data)
        json_data = json.dumps(data)
        
        # Actually save it!
        s3_client.put_object(
            Bucket=bucket_name,      # Which "folder"
            Key=key,                 # Filename
            Body=json_data,          # The data itself
            ContentType='application/json'  # What type of file it is
        )
        
        print(f"‚úÖ Saved '{key}' to S3!")
        return True
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"‚ùå Couldn't save: {e}")
        return False

print("‚úÖ Function created! This saves data to the cloud.")
print("\nüí° Think of it like Ctrl+S, but for cloud storage!")

```

    ‚úÖ Function created! This saves data to the cloud.
    
    üí° Think of it like Ctrl+S, but for cloud storage!


## Step 8: Understanding Risk Levels ü§î

This is important! We need to decide: **How dangerous is each incident?**

We use three levels with **specific crime types**:

- **3 (High Risk)** = Very dangerous crimes:
  - EXPLOSIVE FOUND, EXPLOSION
  - ROBBERY, STRONGARM ROBBERY
  - ASSAULT, BATTERY

- **2 (Medium Risk)** = Somewhat dangerous crimes:
  - PURSE SNATCH, INDECENT EXPOSURE
  - FIGHT W/ WEAPONS, FIGHT W/O WEAPONS
  - BREAKING IN

- **1 (Low Risk)** = Less serious crimes:
  - SUSPICIOUS PERSON
  - THREATS/HARRASMENT, AGGRESIVE/THREATENING
  - ENCAMPMENT

**Special case: ENCAMPMENT** üèïÔ∏è
- If status is "CLOSED" ‚Üí contributes 0 to risk (not dangerous anymore!)
- If status is open ‚Üí doesn't decay with time (stays dangerous until closed)

**Why assign risk?**  
Not all problems are equally dangerous. An assault is much worse than a broken streetlight!



```python
def assign_risk(incident, incident_type):
    """
    Decide how dangerous an incident is.
    
    This is like judging: "How bad is this problem?"
    
    Input:
    - incident: Details about what happened
    - incident_type: Is this crime data or 311 data?
    
    Output:
    - A number (1, 2, or 3) saying how dangerous it is
    """
    
    if incident_type == "crime":
        # Get the crime description
        description = incident.get("call_type_original_desc", "").upper()
        
        # High risk crimes (w=3): Very dangerous
        high_risk_crimes = ["EXPLOSIVE FOUND", "EXPLOSION", "ROBBERY", "STRONGARM ROBBERY", "ASSAULT", "BATTERY"]
        if any(crime in description for crime in high_risk_crimes):
            return 3  # üö® Very dangerous!
        
        # Medium risk crimes (w=2): Somewhat dangerous
        medium_risk_crimes = ["PURSE SNATCH", "INDECENT EXPOSURE", "FIGHT W/ WEAPONS", "FIGHT W/O WEAPONS", "BREAKING IN"]
        if any(crime in description for crime in medium_risk_crimes):
            return 2  # ‚ö†Ô∏è Somewhat dangerous
        
        # Low risk crimes (w=1): Not very dangerous
        low_risk_crimes = ["SUSPICIOUS PERSON", "THREATS/HARASSMENT", "THREATS", "HARASSMENT", "AGGRESSIVE", "THREATENING", "ENCAMPMENT"]
        if any(crime in description for crime in low_risk_crimes):
            return 1  # ‚úÖ Not very dangerous
        
        # Default for unknown crimes
        return 1  # ‚úÖ Assume low risk for unknown
    
    else:  # It's 311 data (street problems)
        # SF 311 data uses service_name
        service_name = incident.get("service_name", "").upper()
        
        # Check for specific service types
        if "ENCAMPMENT" in service_name:
            return 1  # Low risk, but persistent
        elif "AGGRESSIVE" in service_name or "THREATENING" in service_name:
            return 3  # üö® Very dangerous!
        
        # Fallback for old format
        category = incident.get("Category", "").upper()
        if any(word in category for word in ["OBSTRUCTION", "HAZARD", "DEBRIS", "POTHOLES", "SIDEWALK"]):
            return 3  # üö® Trip hazard!
        elif any(word in category for word in ["MAINTENANCE", "REPAIR", "CLEANUP"]):
            return 2  # ‚ö†Ô∏è Annoying
        else:
            return 1  # ‚úÖ No big deal

# Let's test it!
print("üß™ Testing risk assignment:")
print(f"EXPLOSIVE FOUND ‚Üí Risk: {assign_risk({'call_type_original_desc': 'EXPLOSIVE FOUND'}, 'crime')}")
print(f"ROBBERY ‚Üí Risk: {assign_risk({'call_type_original_desc': 'ROBBERY'}, 'crime')}")
print(f"PURSE SNATCH ‚Üí Risk: {assign_risk({'call_type_original_desc': 'PURSE SNATCH'}, 'crime')}")
print(f"ENCAMPMENT ‚Üí Risk: {assign_risk({'call_type_original_desc': 'ENCAMPMENT'}, 'crime')}")
print(f"SIDEWALK HAZARD ‚Üí Risk: {assign_risk({'Category': 'Sidewalk Hazard'}, '311')}")

```

    üß™ Testing risk assignment:
    EXPLOSIVE FOUND ‚Üí Risk: 3
    ROBBERY ‚Üí Risk: 3
    PURSE SNATCH ‚Üí Risk: 2
    ENCAMPMENT ‚Üí Risk: 1
    SIDEWALK HAZARD ‚Üí Risk: 3


## Step 9: Measuring Distance üèÉ

**What we're doing:**  
We need to know: "How far is this incident from our walking route?"

**Why?**  
An incident 10 feet away is MUCH more relevant than one 2 miles away!

**The Math (Don't Worry!):**  
We use "geodesic distance" - this is fancy talk for "distance on Earth" (not as a bird flies, but walking distance).

**Real Life Example:**  
If there's an assault 100 meters from your route, that's concerning.  
If there's an assault 5 kilometers away, who cares? You won't walk near it.

Let's write a function to measure this!



```python
def min_distance_to_path(incident_coords, path):
    """
    Find the shortest distance from an incident to any point on the path.
    
    Think of it like this: 
    If an incident happened at point A, and your route goes through points B, C, D...
    What's the shortest distance from A to any of those points?
    
    Input:
    - incident_coords: Where the incident happened (latitude, longitude)
    - path: Your route (a list of GPS coordinates)
    
    Output:
    - The distance in kilometers
    """
    
    # Safety check: Make sure we have a real path
    if len(path) < 2:
        return float('inf')  # If no path, assume it's infinitely far away
    
    # Start with a really big number
    min_dist = float('inf')
    
    # Check distance to every point on the path
    for path_point in path:
        try:
            # Calculate distance (using geodesic = Earth's curve)
            dist = geodesic(incident_coords, path_point).meters / 1000
            # ^convert meters to kilometers
            
            # Keep track of the smallest distance we found
            min_dist = min(min_dist, dist)
        except:
            # If something goes wrong, just skip it
            continue
    
    return min_dist

# Let's test it!
test_path = [(37.7849, -122.4094), (37.7855, -122.4086)]
test_incident = (37.7865, -122.4080)
test_distance = min_distance_to_path(test_incident, test_path)

print(f"üß™ Test:")
print(f"Incident at: {test_incident}")
print(f"Path goes through: {test_path}")
print(f"Distance: {test_distance:.4f} km")
print("\nüí° The smaller the number, the closer the incident is to your route!")

```

    üß™ Test:
    Incident at: (37.7865, -122.408)
    Path goes through: [(37.7849, -122.4094), (37.7855, -122.4086)]
    Distance: 0.1229 km
    
    üí° The smaller the number, the closer the incident is to your route!


## Step 10: THE MAGIC FORMULA üé©‚ú®

This is where the magic happens! This is the core of our system.

### The Formula (With Time Decay!): 
**For high risk (w=3):** f(d,t,w) = (ReLU(3-3t/72))¬≤ √ó e^(-d¬≤/0.02)  
**For lower risk (w=1,2):** f(d,t,w) = (ReLU(w-wt/24))¬≤ √ó e^(-d¬≤/0.02)

**Breaking it down in simple terms:**

#### Part 1: The Risk Value (with Time!)
- w = How dangerous the incident is (1, 2, or 3)
- t = Time since incident (in hours)
- **High-risk incidents (w=3):** Take 72 hours to fully decay (3 days!)
- **Lower-risk incidents (w=1,2):** Take 24 hours to fully decay (1 day!)

**Why different times?**  
Serious crimes stay dangerous for longer!

#### Part 2: ReLU Function
ReLU(x) = max(0, x) - Returns 0 if negative, otherwise returns the value itself.

**What it does:**  
Prevents the risk from going negative (makes sense - you can't have "negative danger"!)

#### Part 3: e^(-d¬≤/0.02) (Distance Decay)
- d = Distance in kilometers
- Makes things further away matter less

**How it works:**
- Close incident (0.1 km): Contributes a lot
- Medium distance (0.5 km): Contributes some  
- Far away (1+ km): Contributes almost nothing

#### Putting It Together:
A **recent, high-risk incident close** to your path has a huge impact.  
An **old, low-risk incident far away** has almost no impact.

**That's the whole point!** üéØ

    """

    How it works:

    2. Get its risk level (1, 2, or 3)
    3. Measure how far it is from the path

    6. Add it all up

## Step 11: THE MAIN FUNCTION üé™

This brings everything together! Think of it as the conductor of an orchestra - it makes sure everything happens in the right order.

**What it does:**
1. Get crime data
2. Get 311 data
3. Save everything to S3
4. For each path, calculate risk
5. Sort paths by risk
6. Return the 3 safest paths

Let's build it!

## Step 12: Testing with Sample Data üß™

Before using real APIs, let's test with fake data to make sure everything works!

**Why?**  
- We can see what happens
- No need for API keys yet
- Learn how the system works

Let's create some sample incidents and test!



```python
# Let's create some fake data to test with!

# Sample crimes
sample_crimes = [
    {
        "call_type_original_desc": "ASSAULT WITH DEADLY WEAPON",
        "intersection_point": {
            "coordinates": [-122.4090, 37.7855]  # (longitude, latitude)
        }
    },
    {
        "call_type_original_desc": "TRESPASSING",
        "intersection_point": {
            "coordinates": [-122.4080, 37.7850]
        }
    },
    {
        "call_type_original_desc": "NOISE COMPLAINT",
        "intersection_point": {
            "coordinates": [-122.4075, 37.7845]
        }
    }
]

# Sample 311 incidents
sample_311 = [
    {
        "Category": "Sidewalk Hazard",
        "Latitude": 37.7852,
        "Longitude": -122.4085
    },
    {
        "Category": "Trash Removal",
        "Latitude": 37.7858,
        "Longitude": -122.4090
    }
]

# A sample path
test_path = [(37.7849, -122.4094), (37.7855, -122.4086), (37.7861, -122.4078)]

print("‚úÖ Sample data created!")
print(f"   - {len(sample_crimes)} sample crimes")
print(f"   - {len(sample_311)} sample 311 incidents")
print(f"   - 1 test path with {len(test_path)} waypoints")

```

    ‚úÖ Sample data created!
       - 3 sample crimes
       - 2 sample 311 incidents
       - 1 test path with 3 waypoints



```python
# Let's test it!
print("üß™ Testing the system...")
print("=" * 60)

# Calculate risk
crime_risk = calculate_risk_score(test_path, sample_crimes, "crime")
incident_risk = calculate_risk_score(test_path, sample_311, "311")
total_risk = crime_risk + incident_risk

print("\nüìä RESULTS:")
print(f"   Crime Risk:     {crime_risk:.4f}")
print(f"   311 Risk:       {incident_risk:.4f}")
print(f"   TOTAL RISK:     {total_risk:.4f}")
print("\n‚úÖ It works! Lower numbers = safer path.")

print("\n" + "=" * 60)
print("üí° Now you can use real data with the find_lowest_risk_paths() function!")

```

## Step 13: How to Use This System! üöÄ

Now that you understand how it works, here's how to actually use it:



```python
# EXAMPLE: How to use the system with real data

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Define your paths (from Google Maps or another source)
example_polypaths = [
    # Path 1: Short route
    [(37.7849, -122.4094), (37.7855, -122.4086), (37.7861, -122.4078)],
    # Path 2: Different route
    [(37.7849, -122.4094), (37.7845, -122.4102), (37.7841, -122.4110)],
    # Path 3: Alternative route
    [(37.7849, -122.4094), (37.7852, -122.4090), (37.7855, -122.4086)],
    # ... add more paths as needed
]

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ SF Open Data doesn't need API keys! It's public data! üéâ

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run it!
# Uncomment the line below when you're ready:
# lowest_risk_paths = find_lowest_risk_paths(example_polypaths)

# Or if you want to provide optional parameters:
# lowest_risk_paths = find_lowest_risk_paths(
#     example_polypaths,
#     area_bounds=None,  # Not used for SF Open Data
#     crime_api_key=None,  # Not needed
#     api_311_key=None    # Not needed
# )

print("üìù Setup complete!")
print("\nüéâ No API keys needed - SF Open Data is free and public!")
print("\n‚ö†Ô∏è  To actually run it:")
print("   1. Uncomment the find_lowest_risk_paths line")
print("   2. Run the cell!")

```

    üìù Setup complete!
    
    üéâ No API keys needed - SF Open Data is free and public!
    
    ‚ö†Ô∏è  To actually run it:
       1. Uncomment the find_lowest_risk_paths line
       2. Run the cell!


## üéì What You Learned!

Let's review what we built:

### ‚úÖ The System
1. **Gets data** from Crime APIs and 311 APIs
2. **Saves data** to AWS S3 (cloud storage)
3. **Assigns risk** to each incident (1, 2, or 3)
4. **Measures distance** from incidents to paths
5. **Calculates risk** using the magic formula
6. **Returns** the 3 safest paths

### üßÆ The Math
**Formula (with time decay!):** 
- **For w=3:** f(d,t,w) = (ReLU(3-3t/72))¬≤ √ó e^(-d¬≤/0.02)
- **For w=1,2:** f(d,t,w) = (ReLU(w-wt/24))¬≤ √ó e^(-d¬≤/0.02)
- **w** = Risk value (1, 2, or 3)
- **d** = Distance in kilometers
- **Lower total** = Safer path! üéØ

### üîë Key Concepts
- **API**: How programs get data from websites
- **S3**: Cloud storage (like Google Drive for computers)
- **Geodesic**: Distance on Earth's surface
- **Risk Score**: A number showing how dangerous a path is

### üöÄ Next Steps

**To use with real data:**
1. Get API keys for Crime and 311 data
2. Set up AWS account
3. Create S3 bucket
4. Fill in credentials in the notebook
5. Run the main function!

**To learn more:**
- Read about APIs: "How do websites share data?"
- Learn about AWS: "What is cloud computing?"
- Study the formula: "How does exponential decay work?"

### üéâ You Did It!

You now have a complete path safety analysis system!

**Remember:**
- Lower risk scores = Safer paths
- The formula balances distance and danger
- This works for any area with accessible data!

Happy analyzing! üó∫Ô∏è‚ú®
